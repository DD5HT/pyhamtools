PyHamTools is a Python library which helps you creating Amateur Radio applications faster. It comes
with some modules and classes which are frequently needed: 

 - Locator based calculations (distance, heading, sunrise/sunset, Locator to Lat/Long conversion)

 - Checking frequencies against the IARU bandplan or 

 - Parsing Amateur Radio callsigns using Clublog.org_'s or AD1C's Country-Files.com_ database

PyHamTools is used in production at the DXHeat.com DXCluster_, performing several thousand lookups and calculations per day.
